# hyrox-performance-prediction
Data-driven analysis and predictive modeling to estimate if and when the 50-minute barrier will be broken in Hyrox competitions.

# Project Overview
Hyrox is a global fitness race combining running and functional workouts. The current world records are impressive, but can the 50-minute barrier ever be broken in solo races?
This project aims to:

- Analyze historical Hyrox results.
- Model performance trends.
- Predict if and when sub-50 minutes will be achievable.

# Objectives 
- Collect and clean Hyrox race data (times, splits, athlete profiles).
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on performance trends.
- Build predictive models (statistical + physiological).
- Visualize projections and insights.
